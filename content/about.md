## What the hell is this?

An experiment using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). Something to quell my boredom for an afternoon.
Maybe a place to dump things I learn, find interesting or have thoughts about.

## And who the hell are you?

Anca, nice to meet you. 
I live in Timisoara, Romania and work as a software developer, mostly with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 

I studied software engineering at Universitatea Politehnica Timisoara and graduated in 2018. I did a little project to help non-programmers develop (roguelike) games as my bachelor's thesis :).

I sometimes make videogames and bots (the spams-you-on-twitter kind, not the makes-you-coffee-and-pancakes kind) in my free time.
Besides writing code, I do a fair bit of drawing, playing videogames, listening to [music](https://www.last.fm/user/venatrix42), watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/venatrix/) and reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53630264-anca).
